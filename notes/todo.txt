investigate crash after idling on mission clear screen (noticed on tree mission)

fixed(?) bugs:
	fix newgame-market crash
	fix class acts being replaced with ??? on load
	investigate crash after post mission save (noticed in demoBoss)
		apparently always crashes after clearing demoBoss a 2nd time, suspected to be tied to heldGold overflow

class idea:
	Ace
		stance act that changes to whatever type attack was used last
			boosts damage dealt and taken with current type
		weaponmaster type class
	Strider
		explorer type class, has utility skills
		skill that heals party after battles
		skill that increases drop rate
	Battery
		more straightforward s-atk dps
		[chain cast]: stance, insta-cooldown all acts (excluding acts already used) when dealing damage to an elemental weakness
			each proc restarts a timer on the stance, when the timer runs out the list of excluded acts is cleared
		en+ skill
		s-atk+ skill
