mission idea
	aptitude test proctor
		"when no appropriate missions are available for new adventurers, a standardized aptitude test is conducted"
		"escort adventurer to goal and prevent them from getting overwhelmed"
		simple mission, get to the end of a linear path

class idea:
	Editor
		class focused around altering the properties of attacks
		stance that changes to whatever element of attack was used last (does not change for neutral)
			levelling up adds chance to inflict ailment with all attacks based on stance ele
			act that deactivates stance for element burst
		stances that make future attacks scale against a specific defense stat, or scale with the target's atk stat
			levelling up increases how many attacks use this property before the stance deactivates
	Strider
		explorer type class, has utility skills
		skill that heals party after battles
		skill that increases drop rate
		escape battle skill
		heal share skill
	Battery
		more straightforward s-atk dps
		[chain cast]: add tempAgile to all spell attacks
		when a spell attack is "weak" effective, heal user slightly
		en+ skill
		s-atk+ skill
		heal+ skill
		make sub-class friendly
