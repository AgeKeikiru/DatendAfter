mission idea
	
	remove foreign slime (nTundra_03)
		poison slime type out of its element, determine and eliminate source
		boss: corrosion wolfeant
		
	Retake Control Center (vCanal_04)
		"now that we know how to stop GDEs from spawning, we can eliminate the infestation in the Control Center"
		
	Rout Incursion (cLoewi_02)
		"monsters have been summoned in lowee's financial district around a specific building"
		"the area is not well equipped to deal with monsters from the inside, the workers are in danger"
		target: 4+2 enemies
		during target battles the objective meter displays hostage HP, decreases by 1 whenever an enemy attack misses
		
	Destroy Warp Points (cLoewi_03)
		"during the chaos of Rout Incursion warp points were placed in the building to continue spawning monsters"
		"beware of traps to slow you down"
		same map as Rout Incursion
		introduce damage floors
		9 warps
		
	Assist Layered Forces (zDesert_02)
		"Layered has found the location of the sorcerer that attacked the Control Center and Financial District"
		"weaken the defenses around the stronghold to allow Layered forces to breach the entrance"
		destroy a certain number of enemies to complete the mission
		mana charged
		
	Layered Training Exercise (nTundra_04)
		"a group of Layered squires are on a training patrol, ambush them to test their abilities"
		battle starts immediately
		5 layered theme enemies (gun/shield/mage + gun,mage)

class idea:
	Editor
		class focused around altering the properties of attacks
		stance that changes to whatever element of attack was used last (does not change for neutral)
			levelling up adds chance to inflict ailment with all attacks based on stance ele
			act that deactivates stance for element burst
		stances that make future attacks scale against a specific defense stat, or scale with the target's atk stat
			levelling up increases how many attacks use this property before the stance deactivates
