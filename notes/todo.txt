mission idea
	aptitude test proctor
		"when no appropriate missions are available for new adventurers, a standardized aptitude test is conducted"
		"escort adventurer to goal and prevent them from getting overwhelmed"
		simple mission, get to the end of a linear path
		
	Investigate Control Center (canal)
		"the town is reporting power outage issues and attempts to contact control center staff have all failed"
		"surveilance shows no visible entry, but the entrance you normally take has been blocked due to damage, suggesting an attack from within"
		introduce glitch enemies, NPC is Harzer
		group retreats at end of mission
		
	Investigate Aberration Sighting (woods)
		"creatues similar to the glitches, now referred to as GDEs (Garbage Data Entities) have appeared"
		mission is interrupted by Blaze's team when a massive GDE appears
		Blaze's team replaces party for boss fight
		
	Retake Control Center (canal)
		"now that we know how to stop GDEs from spawning, we can eliminate the infestation in the Control Center"
		new missions in the area will not appear until this mission is completed
		
	Diversionary Attack (desert)
		"launch an attack on a Leosocial Research Lab to draw out their defensive forces"
		reward based on enemies defeated in alloted time
		unique enemy effect: camera drone - if it lands an attack on the party the mission ends early
		
	Destroy Prototype Equipment (tundra)
		"Zikade will be testing equipment made using tech stolen from Leosocial, interrupt the test and destroy the equipment"
		enemies are Newtypes
		reward: class chip [Newtype(D)]: a damaged newtype chip that only has tier 1-2 skills
		
	Rout Incursion (lowee)
		"monsters have been summoned in lowee's financial district around a specific building"
		"the area is not well equipped to deal with monsters from the inside, the workers are in danger"
		target: 4+2 enemies
		during target battles the objective meter displays hostage HP, decreases by 1 whenever a party member is hit
		
	Destroy Warp Points (lowee)
		"during the chaos of Rout Incursion warp points were placed in the building to continue spawning monsters"
		"beware of traps to slow you down"
		same map as Rout Incursion
		introduce damage floors
		9 warps
		
	Assist Layered Forces (desert)
		"Layered has found the location of the sorcerer that attacked the Control Center and Financial District"
		"weaken the defenses around the stronghold to allow Layered forces to breach the entrance"
		destroy a certain number of enemies to complete the mission
		introduce mana charged terrain effect
		
	Eliminate Infestation (lowee)
		"a control rod in one of lowee's mana reactors has malfunctioned, and slime is being generated at an alarming rate"
		"eliminate the slimes so workers can repair the control rod, but avoid damaging the facility"
		mana charged
		objective meter shows facility HP, decreases by 1 when a party member attack misses
		
	Layered Training Exercise (tundra)
		"a group of Layered squires are on a training patrol, ambush them to test their abilities"
		battle starts immediately
		5 layered theme enemies (gun/shield/mage + gun,mage)

class idea:
	Editor
		class focused around altering the properties of attacks
		stance that changes to whatever element of attack was used last (does not change for neutral)
			levelling up adds chance to inflict ailment with all attacks based on stance ele
			act that deactivates stance for element burst
		stances that make future attacks scale against a specific defense stat, or scale with the target's atk stat
			levelling up increases how many attacks use this property before the stance deactivates
	Strider
		explorer type class, has utility skills
		skill that heals party after battles
		skill that increases drop rate
		escape battle skill
		heal share skill
	Battery
		more straightforward s-atk dps
		[chain cast]: add tempAgile to all spell attacks
		when a spell attack is "weak" effective, heal user slightly
		en+ skill
		s-atk+ skill
		heal+ skill
		make sub-class friendly
